## FeedReader Testing
In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. This project focuses on writing test cases using Jasmine [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/). The test cases are written in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js

### Packages used
Jasmine 2.1.2

### Setup Instructions to host your own web server
* **Node JS for localhost web server**:  Install Node JS by following instructions from here https://nodejs.org/en/download/
* **Ngrok for webserver over proxy**: Install ngrok by following instructions from here: https://ngrok.com/download
* **Gulp as build configuration tool**: From Node JS command prompt, install gulp by following instructions from here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-download
* **Gulp modules required to run our web app**: From Node JS command prompt, install the following gulp modules:
    * gulp-uglify
    * gulp-util
    * gulp-rename
    * gulp-clean-css
    * gulp-imagemin
    * gulp-image-resize
    * gulp-htmlmin
    * browser-sync
    * ngrok
    * run-sequence
as defined in package.json by typing the following command:
```
npm install
```

### Starting Web App
##### From github server
* The web app is hosted on https://uthraragavan.github.io/FeedReader

##### Hosting your own web server on ngrok

* **Download the project assets from Github**: https://github.com/uthraragavan/FeedReader
* **Starting web app**: From Node JS command prompt, navigate to the project asset folder on your system and type gulp. This will start the web app over ngrok proxy. A browser window showing index.html from dist folder shows up. The gulp command from command prompt should display something like this:
 ```
